# covidIsolate

covidIsolate is an open source app, designed to indicate if a subject (user of the app), was in contact with an infectious user of the app.
The goal is to build the app as decentralized and anonymous as possible to prevent abuse, while poviding a secure and reliable platform to the enduser.
Disclaimer: This app is just a prototype and could, due to the lack of resources, not be tested in the real world!
